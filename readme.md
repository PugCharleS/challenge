# Welcome to my SDE Code Exercise Solution!

Hi! I'm **Carlos Solis**. If you want to use this code you just need to follow the next steps:

1.  Go to your terminal and create a directory where you want to clone the code
2.  Enter to that directory with **"cd ./{name of the directory}"**
3.  Type **git clone https://github.com/PugCharleS/challenge.git**
4.  Enter to the directory that has created inside so **"cd ./challenge"**
5.  In the terminal type the next command **"npm i"** this should download any library that is required to execute the code.
6.  In the command line enter node **./scripts/index.js** to execute the code
7.  And you are good to go.

# Files

## Scripts Directory

### index.js

This is where we run the whole code and run the main tasks to get the suitability score and the correspondance that is required.

## Helpers Directory

### capitalize.js

Here we can find a function that it returns a capitalize string
E.g.
hello world -> Hello World

### character.js

Here we will find the arrays that are needed to use in index.js

### gcd.js

Here we will find a function that alculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers using recursion. It return a number that indicates wheter it has a gcd.
